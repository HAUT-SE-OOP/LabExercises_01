Lab Exercise 1 — Modifying Class Account

I  Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will practice:
	Creating member functions.
	Invoking functions and receiving return values from functions.
	Testing a condition using an if statement.
	Outputting variables with stream insertion and the cout object.

II  Description of the Problem
Modify class Account to provide a member function called debit that withdraws money from an Account. Ensure that the debit amount does not exceed the Account’s balance. If it does, the balance should be left unchanged and the function should print a message indicating "Debit amount exceeded account balance." Modify class AccountTest to test member function debit.

III  Sample Output
 
IV  Your Solution
// Lab 1: Account.cpp
// Member-function definitions for class Account.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "Account.h" // include definition of class Account

// Account constructor initializes data member balance
Account::Account( int initialBalance )
{
   balance = 0; // assume that the balance begins at 0

   // if initialBalance is greater than 0, set this value as the
   // balance of the Account; otherwise, balance remains 0
   if ( initialBalance > 0 )
      balance = initialBalance;

   // if initialBalance is negative, print error message
   if ( initialBalance < 0 )
      cout << "Error: Initial balance cannot be negative.\n" << endl;
} // end Account constructor

// credit (add) an amount to the account balance
void Account::credit( int amount )
{
   balance = balance + amount; // add amount to balance
} // end function credit

void Account::debit( int amount)
{
    //if amount is no greater than balance
    //subtract amount to balance
    if(amount<=balance)//if amount
        balance=balance-amount;
     //if amount is greater than balance,print error message
    if(amount>balance)
       cout<<"Debit amount exceeded account balance."<<endl;
}//end function debit
/* write code to define member function debit. */

// return the account balance
int Account::getBalance()
{
   return balance; // gives the value of balance to the calling function
} // end function getBalance

   Account( int ); // constructor initializes balance
   void credit( int ); // add an amount to the account balance
   void debit( int );
//if this is ture,subtract an amount to the account balance 
   /* write code to declare member function debit. */
   int getBalance(); // return the account balance
private:
   int balance; // data member that stores the balance
}; // end class Account

// Lab 1: AccountTest.cpp
// Create and manipulate Account objects.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// include definition of class Account from Account.h
#include "Account.h"

// function main begins program execution
int main()
{
   Account account1( 50 ); // create Account object
   Account account2( 0 ); // create Account object

   // display initial balance of each object
   cout << "account1 balance: $" << account1.getBalance() << endl;
   cout << "account2 balance: $" << account2.getBalance() << endl;

   int withdrawalAmount; // stores withdrawal amount read from user

   cout << "\nEnter withdrawal amount for account1: "; // prompt
   cin >> withdrawalAmount; // obtain user input
   cout << "\nsubtracting " << withdrawalAmount
      << " from account1 balance\n\n";
   account1.debit(withdrawalAmount);
   /* write code to withdraw money from account1 */

   // display balances
   cout << "account1 balance: $" << account1.getBalance() << endl;
   cout << "account2 balance: $" << account2.getBalance() << endl;

   cout << "\nEnter withdrawal amount for account2: "; // prompt

	Creating a class definition.
	Declaring data members.
	Defining a constructor.
	Defining set and get functions.
	Writing a test application to demonstrate the capabilities of another class.

II  Description of the Problem
Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as data members—a first name (type string), a last name (type string) and a monthly salary (type int). Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three data members. Provide a set and a get function for each data member. If the monthly salary is not positive, set it to 0. Write a test program that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary.

Lab Exercise 4 — Complex Numbers

I  Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will practice:
	Creating new data types by writing class definitions.
	Defining member functions of programmer-defined classes.
	Instantiating objects from programmer-defined classes.
	Calling member functions of programmer-defined classes.
The follow-up questions and activities will also give you practice:
	Initializing programmer-defined class data members with class constructors.

II  Description of the Problem
Create a class called Complex for performing arithmetic with complex numbers. Write a program to test your class. 
Complex numbers have the form：
realPart + imaginaryPart * i
where i is
√(-1)
Use double variables to represent the private data of the class. Provide a constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialized when it is declared. The constructor should contain default values in case no initializers are provided. Provide public member functions that perform the following tasks:
1) Adding two Complex numbers: The real parts are added together and the imaginary parts are added together.
2) Subtracting two Complex numbers: The real part of the right operand is subtracted from the real part of the left operand and the imaginary part of the right operand is subtracted from the imaginary part of the left operand.
3) Printing Complex numbers in the form (a, b) where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.

V  Follow-Up Questions and Activities
	Why do you think const was used in the parameter list of add and subtract?
    因为const不能改变参数，但可以被引用，完成后函数参数值不变
	Can add and subtract’s parameters be passed by value instead of by reference? How might this affect the design of class Complex? Write a new class definition that illustrates how the parameters would be passed by value.
可以通过值来传递
只需要对运算符进行重载

The follow-up questions and activities also will give you practice:
	Overloading constructors and using default arguments with constructors.
	Defining a destructor.

II  Description of the Problem

Lab Exercise 6 — Simple Calculator

I  Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will practice:
	Using classes to create a data type Simple Calculator capable of performing arithmetic operations.
	Creating const member functions to enforce the principle of least privilege.
The follow-up questions and activities also will give you practice:
	Using constructors to specify initial values for data members of a programmer-defined class.

II  Description of the Problem
Write a SimpleCalculator class that has public methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing two doubles. A sample call is as follows:
double answer = sc.add( a, b );
Object sc is of type SimpleCalculator. Member function add returns the result of adding its two arguments.

III  Sample Output
 
 
IV Your Solution
// Lab Exercise 6: CalcTest.cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "SimpleCalculator.h"

int main()
{
   SimpleCalculator sc;
   double a = 10.0;
   double b = 20.0;

   /* Instantiate an object of type Simplecalculator */
   cout << "The value of a is: " << a << "\n";
   cout << "The value of b is: " << b << "\n\n";

   /* Write a line that adds a and b through your SimpleCalculator
      object; assign the result to a variable named addition */
   double addition = sc.add( a, b );
   cout << "Adding a and b yields " << addition << "\n";

   double subtraction = sc.subtract( a, b );
   cout << "Subtracting b from a yields " << subtraction << "\n";

   double multiplication = sc.multiply( a, b );
   cout << "Multiplying a by b yields " << multiplication << "\n";

   /* Write a line that divides a and b through the
      SimpleCalculator object; assign the result to a
	  variable named division */
   double division = sc.divide( a, b );
   cout << "Dividing a by b yields " << division << endl;
}
// Lab Exercise 6: SimpleCalculator.cpp

#include "SimpleCalculator.h"

double SimpleCalculator::add( double a, double b ) const
{
    return a+b;
}
/* Write definition for add member function */

// function subtract definition
double SimpleCalculator::subtract( double a, double b ) const
{
   return a - b;
} // end function subtract

// function multiply definition
double SimpleCalculator::multiply( double a, double b ) const
{
   return a * b;
} // end function multiply

double SimpleCalculator::divide( double a, double b ) const
{
    return a/b;
}
/* Write definition for divide member function */
// Lab Exercise 6: SimpleCalculator.h

// class SimpleCalculator definition
class SimpleCalculator
{
public:
   double add( double, double ) const; 
   /* Write prototype for add member function */
   double subtract( double, double ) const; 
   double multiply( double, double ) const;
   double divide( double, double ) const; 
   /* Write prototype for divide member function */
}; // end class SimpleCalculator
  
V  Follow-Up Questions and Activities
	Why doesn’t the SimpleCalculator class have a constructor?
参数无需进行初始化
	Why are no private data members needed for class SimpleCalculator?
返回值直接可以利用参数的表达式进行表述无需再设私有数据成员
	Modify your class so that SimpleCalculator has a private data member called answer. After performing an operation, assign the result to answer. Add a member function named getAnswer to retrieve the result of the last arithmetic operation performed by the object. Also, add a constructor for class SimpleCalculator that initializes the value of answer to 0.
#include "SimpleCalculator.h"

void SimpleCalculator::add( double a, double b ) 
{
    answer=a+b;
}
/* Write definition for add member function */

// function subtract definition
void SimpleCalculator::subtract( double a, double b ) 
{
   answer= a - b;
} // end function subtract

// function multiply definition
void SimpleCalculator::multiply( double a, double b )
{
   answer= a * b;
} // end function multiply

void SimpleCalculator::divide( double a, double b )
{
    answer=a/b;
}
double SimpleCalculator::getAnswer( double a, double b ) const
{
Return answer;
}

	Modify the program so that the SimpleCalculator class has an input member function that allows the user to input two doubles. The function should then store the values that were input in private data members. Use these two values for each of the arithmetic calculations. Create two constructors for this class, one that takes no arguments and initializes a and b to 0 and another that takes two doubles and initializes a and b to those values. Finally, create a member function printValues that displays the values of a and b. A segment of the driver program might now look like this:
 

Void SimpleCalculator::printValues()const

*Lab Exercise 7 — Integer Set

I  Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will practice:
	Using classes to create a data type, IntegerSet, capable of storing a set of integers
	Using dynamic memory allocation with the new and delete operators
The follow-up questions and activities also will give you practice:
	Using destructors to deallocate memory that was dynamically allocated.

II  Description of the Problem
Create class IntegerSet for which each object can hold integers in the range 0 through 100. A set is represented internally as an array of ones and zeros. Array element a[ i ] is 1 if integer i is in the set. Array element a[ j ] is 0 if integer j is not in the set. The default constructor initializes a set to the so-called “empty-set,” i.e., a set whose array representation contains all zeros. 
Provide member functions for the common set operations. For example, a unionOfSets member function (already provided) creates a third set that is the set-theoretic union of two existing sets (i.e., an element of the third array’s is set to 1 if that element is 1 in either or both of the existing sets, and an element of the third set’s array is set to 0 if that element is 0 in each of the existing sets).
Provide an intersectionOfSets member function which creates a third set which is the set-theoretic intersection of two existing sets (i.e., an element of the third set’s array is set to 0 if that element is 0 in either or both of the existing sets, and an element of the third set’s array is set to 1 if that element is 1 in each of the existing sets).
An insertElement member function (already provided) inserts a new integer k into a set (by setting a[ k ] to 1 ). Provide a deleteElement member function that deletes integer m (by setting a[ m ] to 0 ). 
A printSet member function (already provided) prints a set as a list of numbers separated by spaces. Print only those elements which are present in the set (i.e., their position in the array has a value of 1 ). Print --- for an empty set. 
Provide an isEqualTo member function that determines whether two sets are equal.
Provide an additional constructor that receives an array of integers and the size of that array and uses the array to initialize a set object.
Now write a driver program to test your IntegerSet class. Instantiate several IntegerSet objects. Test that all your member functions work properly.

V  Follow-Up Questions and Activities
	Why might it be advantageous for the set array to be allocated dynamically using new [], if the IntegerSet class were to be used for more general sets?
